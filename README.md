# Customer Churn Prediction App üìä

This **Customer Churn Prediction App** is built using **Streamlit** and a pre-trained TensorFlow model. It predicts the likelihood of a customer churning based on various demographic and account-related inputs.

Access the app in your browser at [ann-predict-application](https://ann-predict-application.streamlit.app/).

---

## Features üöÄ
- **Interactive User Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting customer details.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Provides a customer churn probability based on user inputs.
- **Intuitive Results**: Displays predictions clearly with conditional formatting for easy interpretation.
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Utilizes encoders and scalers for preprocessing customer data seamlessly.

---

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Backend**: TensorFlow (Keras), Scikit-learn
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `numpy`, `pandas`: Data manipulation and processing
  - `pickle`: Serialization and deserialization of models and encoders
  - `streamlit`: Web application framework
  - `tensorflow`: Model training and predictions

---

## How It Works üîç

### Input Customer Details:
- The user provides inputs like **geography**, **gender**, **age**, **balance**, **credit score**, etc., through a clean UI.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Inputs are encoded and scaled using pre-trained encoders and scalers to match the format required by the model.

### Model Prediction:
- The app uses a TensorFlow model (`model.h5`) to predict the churn probability.
- Predictions are displayed along with helpful interpretations.

## Installation Steps ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/viswadarshan-024/DL-ANN-application.git
   cd churn-prediction-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Place the required files in the root directory**:
   - `model.h5`: Trained TensorFlow model.
   - `label_encoder_gender.pkl`: Label encoder for the gender feature.
   - `onehot_encoder_geo.pkl`: One-hot encoder for the geography feature.
   - `scaler.pkl`: Scaler for data normalization.

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
